# LoanBalance
Prints the month-by-month status of a loan balance.

This program reads from the terminal window the initial balance of a loan, the monthly interest rate, and the constant monthly
payment. The program then prints a labeled table showing the month number and the balance at the beginning of that month
(the balance at the beginning of the month 1 is the amount borrowed). The program continues printing until a payment would
cause the balance to drop to zero or below. This program also prints the final payment necessary to close the loan,
the total amount made in payments, and the "cost" of the loan (total payments - loan).
